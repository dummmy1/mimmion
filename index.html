        The Minions are small, yellow capsule-shaped creatures with round gray glasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are depicted as being roughly one-third to one-half the height
        </p>
        <p>
          of humans but they were later revealed to be 3 feet 7 inches (1.1 m) tall. They have one or two eyes, and their
        </p>
        <p>
          irises are almost always brown (except for Bob, who has one green and one brown eye).
        </p>
        <p>
          There appears to be no other difference between the two types beyond the number and color of eyes,
        </p>
        <p>
          and their height. They have no discernible noses but seem capable of smelling, as they are shown smelling fruit and

        <p>
          are affected by the Fart Gun. They are also shown without ears but can hear and respond to sounds. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Minions appear either bald or with a few wispy strands of black hair on their heads.

          After leaving their home country of Switzerland in favor of a new life in America during the late 1960s,

          their clothing consists of blue overalls emblazoned with Gru's logo, black rubber gloves, shoes, and goggles.

          they also possess exceptional engineering abilities, being able to design and construct spaceships

          Minions, the 2015 animated feature film, shows that they have existed since the beginning of life on Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minions are biologically wired to seek out and serve the most terrible of villains; when they have no "boss" to serve,
        </p>
        <p>
          they become depressed and listless. They are also shown to have a degree of invulnerability, as Kevin, Stuart and Bob are able to survive a European

          the Minions are revealed to have an almost uncontrollable craving for fruit, especially bananas.
